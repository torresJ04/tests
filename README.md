Give it a name and copy it. It will be needed because we will set it once in our code.


## **Step 2: Generate an HTTPS Token**

To securely interact with this repository using HTTPS, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Bitbucket account.
2. Go to **Personal Settings**.
3. Navigate to **HTTP Access Tokens**.
4. Click **Create token**.
5. Add a token name (e.g., `TicketMakerToken`) and ensure it has the necessary repository permissions (read/write).
6. Copy the generated token and save it securely (you will not be able to see it again).

## **Step 3: Clone the Repository**

To clone the repository using your HTTPS token and set it up, follow the commands below:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://<username>:<your-https-token>@git.rdisoftware.com:8443/scm/~jpedro/ticketmaker.git

# Replace <username> with your Bitbucket username (e.g., jpedro)
# Replace <your-https-token> with the token generated in Step 2

# Example:
git clone https://user:account-https-token@git.rdisoftware.com:8443/scm/isct/jiraticketmaker.git


# Navigate into the repository
cd jiraticketmaker


```

## Step 4: Set up Jira credentials

## Step 5: Compile the code to get a .exe file

Make sure to get python from Company Portal.


With it installed, run in a powershell window:

`pip install auto-py-to-exe`

Then navigate to the path of the ticketApp.py file you have cloned. Make sure you are in the same directory of the .py file, and run the following command:

`pyinstaller .\ticketApp.py`

The process of building up the app will start and should get finished within few seconds
